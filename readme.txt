My PC has a GIGABYTE motherboard, its BIOS supports FAT & NTFS.

I sent to GIGABYTE - eSupport:

Hi

Feature request: F2FS support for the BIOS (why not in general too, for other motherboards).
2 advantages:
Directly boot a F2FS partition, without another ESP (EFI system partition) of another file system (e.g. FAT32).
Eventually have a new BIOS update file in the/a F2FS partition to Q-Flash instead of another file system.

Best regards.

The answer:

Dear customer,

Thank you for emailing GIGABYTE.
We would like to help you with your technical inquiry.

Reply about the issue:

The BIOS of our MB do not support F2FS

Your feature request proposes support for F2FS (Flash-Friendly File System) in BIOS setups, particularly for motherboard firmware updates (e.g., via Q-Flash) and booting directly from F2FS partitions.

While it is technically feasible to integrate F2FS support into BIOS firmware, the challenges related to backward compatibility, the need for updates in bootloaders, and the transition from FAT32 would make it a complex change. For now, using F2FS for boot partitions and BIOS updates would likely require modifications and collaboration between motherboard manufacturers, BIOS vendors, and the operating systems to ensure proper support. However, your feature request could open the door for new possibilities, especially for systems optimized for flash storage where F2FS's performance advantages could be more fully realized.

Best regards.
Regards
